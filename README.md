## Getting Started & Installation

To get started, download the **Expo Go** app on your phone, clone this repository and run the following commands in the project directory:

```sh
$ npm install
$ expo start
```

`npm install` will install all of the dependencies you need for development, and `expo start` will start the local development server. You can scan the QR code in the terminal with your phone to see a live preview of the app and your local changes.
